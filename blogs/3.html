Remember those days, when the whole family excitedly waited for the prime-time, to finally be able to watch what happened after the last cliffhanger episode, on the black and white television set with its antennas losing signals at the worst possible moment on earth? 
TV and cable networks have been a long staple of entertainment, gradually evolving over the years. Now to be endangered by the onset of OTT video platforms. While TV taught us sermons on patience, the binge-watching culture has swept all those ethos aside. One doesn't need to wait for a new episode to air for over a week anymore, the content is only a click away. The option of multiple choices just adds to its favour, which lacked in the limited bundled packs of cable TV. 
Although OTT mirrors from the traditional video stack, it enables distinctive characteristics and features that may not be possible otherwise. It includes the sheer breadth of content available, flexibility of time and place for viewing content, and the leisure of the consumer to choose from the content offered by the companies. 
Streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, Apple TV, Youtube, etc. provide user based content. The shift from the producer to the consumer is more eminent in these ventures. This is so because the consumer would want to subscribe to the service, only when s/he does find something worth spending on, and not just what the producer wants to offer. 
In fact this caused chaos even in the cable TV world, because the viewers, now, preferred to pay only for those channels which they wanted to watch. The network providers had to 'unbundle' various packs of channels which were created for a cheaper amount, so that a larger amount of coverage was provided to a greater number of channels from the same parent branch. 
Netflix is said to be spending some $12 billion a year in service of disrupting television. In spite of this, TV firmly holds onto its position. This can be justified by the fact that despite the rise of OTT media, a major chunk of the advertisement industry still flourishes on TV. There's a reason why it's called soap-opera, because of the soap advertisements which heavily funded the shows. 
The technology of smart TVs, add up the two experiences, i.e. OTT media and the TV. Thus, creating a symbiotic binary between the two. One can watch daily soaps, along with streaming an episode of the latest Netflix release. 
  
The collaboration creates a space where one sustains the present and future of the other. Thus, creating a peaceful coexistence.
