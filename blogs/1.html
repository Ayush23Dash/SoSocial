<h1>Digital and social media marketing. An asset for companies<br></h1>
<hr>
<p>Do you wish viewing all those google ads, promotional videos, and creative marketing campaigns that one of those belonged to your company?
 If yes, then you must know that in this era of globalization, where everyone can be seen with a smartphone and a social media handle, digital and social media marketing can be a make or break point for any company.
The number of global internet users increased from 3.9 billion in 2017 to a whooping 4.13 billion in 2019. With this rise, companies need to set their brand apart from others and create brand awareness in the general public.
Reaching out to the target audience, cost effectiveness, forming a brand loyalty, and gaining new customers are only some of the many benefits companies achieve through such marketing. Thus it can be rightly said that digital and social media marketing is an asset for every emerging and existing company.<br>
Marketing refers to selling and promoting products and services after a fair amount of research. In today’s time when individuals are synonymous to electronic devices, social media is the greatest influencer of people’s likes, dislikes and wants. Social marketing targets only the use of social media platforms, while digital marketing involves both online and offline promotions. 
Thus, by their core definition both mediums are extremely essential for any growing company or organisation. If a new brand wants to create a market, they need to establish their worth and value on these platforms as a result of which they target the population of their choice. For example, the older generation tends to use Facebook a lot more than Instagram or twitter and hence this filtration helps the brand. Therefore, as social media is an open source, new start-ups are in the race alongside big brands to position themselves in the market. <br>
In this time of extreme reliance on virtuality and visual sensory stimulation, digital and social media marketing provides a strong platform for product endorsements, along with being able to give a deep insight into the consumer preferences and their psyche, that too in a minute span of time.

The ephemeral nature of the online experience is what brings in the thrill factor for both the parties involved. Besides virtual content flows quite smoothly, rather than the slag of physical entities. 

All this comes with the added benefit of instant feedback. If on the positive side, gives a major boost to one's ventures. In fact the large numbers on the platform provide an easy access to targets for sampling and surveys. 

Thus, even if the competition is intense, the opportunity to reach millions, at the same time, has never been easier.
